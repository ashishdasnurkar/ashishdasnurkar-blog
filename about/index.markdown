Hi, I'm Ashish Dasnurkar. I was born and brought up in India. Currently I'm living in this beautiful island country called Taiwan. 

I am a web developer with over 10 years of professional experience. I started my career developing natural language tranlation Windows desktop applications in VC++. Later I moved on to develop e-learning application using ASP. After that I developed standalone CLI application in Java and eventually progressed to web development on Java platform using Servlets/JSP and more recently using ZK Ajax framework. For the past 5 years I have worked on ZK Ajax framework and related products.

Most of my experience is in developing backend solutions with Java platform but since joining ZK I have also done Frontend development using JavaScript/CSS.

With the explosion of various web technologies/libraries/frameworks in recent years it is quite exciting to learn what is achievable on the web.

You can find my complete professional career details on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashishdasnurkar)

Currently I'm a self employed freelancer/consultant working on MEAN stack and Android platform. 

My objective of creating this tech blog is to share whatever I learn and find interesting related to web development.

Other than programming I dabble into photography. I am most interested in street photography. As much as I would like to wonder streets/alleys of Taipei taking street photos, I find less time to do so lately because I have two very young kids and I find myself drawn to capture their wonderful childhood moments instead. Follow me on [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ashishlin/) if you are interested in my photography escapades.
