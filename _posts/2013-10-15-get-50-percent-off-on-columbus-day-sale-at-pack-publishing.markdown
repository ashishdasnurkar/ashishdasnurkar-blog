Just learned about huge [Columbus Day sale at Pakt Publishing](http://bit.ly/1bqvB29). Get 50% off on any eBook or Video screencast purchase before Oct 17th. I have had a very good experience with Packt Pub books, great quality and well written and edited books. I used their book on ZK to prepare before getting a job at ZK so I know what I am talking about and also have since lot of their other books.

Here is a press release for the details on this [sale](http://bit.ly/1bqvB29)
